/*mario is kind of slowing a bit at the end of the screen- controlled by animation timing function.
it kind of determines at the rate at which the element being animated kind of goes fr A to B. Default value is ease.
It means, it starts a little slower then speeds up in the middle and then it ends slowly.*/
